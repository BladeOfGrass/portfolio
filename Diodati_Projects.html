                      <h5><em>September - October, 2017</em><br/></h5>
                      <h4>This project involved working with scratch to make a 
                      game entirely from scratch. It was the first project that 
                      I worked on in the Computer and Software Engineering class
                      I'm taking currently. This project was worked on from the 
                      end of September, and ended in early October. The goal of 
                      the game was to get as many coins as possible while also 
                      getting through each level. My main role was brainstorming 
                      and creating the ideas and design for the gameplay, tech,
                      and balance in the game, while also recording and logging
                      our progress in the project. This experience helped me
                      understand the style that you might develop a game or 
                      software in a group environment. The game had 5 levels,
                      each with increasing difficulty and unique mechanics for
                      each. We worked by discussing what we finished and need 
                      to finish at the start and the end of the day, evaluating
                      what we should do when any problems arose. This system
                      allowed us to work very efficiently and finish objectives
                      quickly.</h4>

                      <h4>The hangman project was a project with the use of the 
                      coding language Python, to code a hangman game using 
                      functions to seperate systems within the code. This was 
                      accomplished with 2 other partners, and we worked on 
                      designing and creating systems from modules to keep track
                      of letters picked, to the ACII art that we created to 
                      give a graphical experience when playing the game.</h4>
