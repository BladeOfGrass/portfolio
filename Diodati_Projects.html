                      <h4>This project involved working with scratch to make a 
                      game entirely from scratch. It was the first project that 
                      I worked on in the Computer and Software Engineering class
                      I'm taking currently. This project was worked on from the 
                      end of September, and ended in early October. The goal of 
                      the game was to get as many coins as possible while also 
                      getting through each level. My main role was brainstorming 
                      and creating the ideas and design for the gameplay, tech,
                      and balance in the game, while also recording and logging
                      our progress in the project. This experience helped me
                      understand the style that you might develop a game or 
                      software in a group environment. The game had 5 levels,
                      each with increasing difficulty and unique mechanics for
                      each. We worked by discussing what we finished and need 
                      to finish at the start and the end of the day, evaluating
                      what we should do when any problems arose. This system
                      allowed us to work very efficiently and finish objectives
                      quickly.</h4>

                      <h4>The hangman project was a project that utilized the 
                          language Python to code a hangman game using 
                      functions to seperate systems within the code. This was 
                      accomplished with 2 other partners, and we worked on 
                      designing and creating systems from modules to keep track
                      of letters picked, to the ACII art that we created to 
                      give a graphical experience when playing the game.
                      I learned how to effieciently use local variables, 
                      eliminating the need for global variables, as well as 
                      the refinement and speed in which I code python. The
                      project was well planned and spaced out, therefore the 
                      requirements needed to finish it was quickly met and 
                      polished with both detail and ease.</h4>

                      <h4>Project 1.2.7 was an individual pruduct which had a goal 
                          of creating a printed circuit 
                          board from scratch through the full fabrication process. 
                          This endeavor included me breadboarding, simulating, designing,
                          masking, etching, soldering, and documentation in order to complete the 
                          creation of my PCB. I made a 4 key piano with octaves, 
                          letting one play a total of 12 different notes on the 
                          push buttons. The full design and fabrication process 
                          took about three weeks.

                      <h4>Project 2.3.5 was an individual project that required the
                          creation of a seven segment display which scrolls through
                          the message "thiswasatruimph!" in a loop. The project
                          mainly involved the use of a PLD (Programmable Logic Device)
                          to run the logic circuit for my circuit. This means there were
                          8 different logic equations for the 8 (includes the dot LED) LEDs 
                          on the seven segment display. Logic converters were used to simplify
                          and create the simulated logic circuits present in the PLD. A clock
                          and counter in the circuit was used to continuously scroll through
                          the message at the right frequency. The PLD was then hooked up to a 
                          breadboard and a common anode seven segment display to show the
                          scrolling message properly. The whole project took about a week.
