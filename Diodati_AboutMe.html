                  <h4 class="paragraph">Hello there! I’m Zachary Diodati, but my friends call me Dio. In order to invent new industries and play around in this sandbox known as the universe, I want to become a mechatronics engineer and explore technological potential. I can do this, hopefully, while making new friends and learning new things on my journey. I’ve taken various engineering classes, such as computer science/engineering, cybersecurity, and currently digital electronics. I plan to utilise all of my skills to create my own tech company that provides unique and inventive solutions, improvements, or advancements to the aspects of everyday life.</h4>
                  <h4 class"paragraph">My life at the moment contains staying at home during the quarantine and keeping up with homework. I've accepted admission into Purdue, so that's exciting! Currently, I’m also taking a digital electronics class, which deals with designing and prototyping electrical circuits. When I have time (the little that I have) I enjoy working on personal projects such as painting Nerf guns, Building various LARP weapons, trying to make a company, soldering, coding machine learning AI, Playing with IMUs, playing video games, and doing whatever else I feel is interesting at the moment. Because of this I tend to dabble in almost everything, from engineering and science to cooking and random tomfoolery.</h4>
                  <h4 class="paragraph">I fuel my soul with curiosity. I like to try new things and give myself new perspectives. I think more people should try it because it's really enlightening when looking at life, it's fun! </h4>
                 	<h4 class="paragraph">This site contains all sorts of things, like my resume, projects I have done, and a bit about me as well! I hope you enjoy looking at the rest of the website, as I had fun creating it! Thank you for your time to take a look at me and my interests!</h4>
