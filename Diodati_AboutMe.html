                  <h4 class="paragraph">Hoi! I am Zachary Diodati, a human that lives in Dublin, California. I want to become a mechatronics engineer to learn and invent with possibilities, learn some other useful things such as marketing, while making friends and networking myself along the journey. Finally with everything I learned, I'll utilise my skills to then create my own tech company, providing unique and inventive solutions, improvements, or advancements to the aspects of everyday life.</h4>
                  <h4 class"paragraph">My life at the moment mostly consists of school and homework, but I try to do feed my interests when I can. When I have time (the little that I have) I enjoy working on personal projects such as painting Nerf guns, Building various foam weapons, soldering, making, constructing, playing video games, and simply doing whatever I feel really interesting at the moment. Because of this I tend to dabble in almost everything, from engineering and science to cooking and random tomfoolery.</h4>
                  <h4 class="paragraph">Many people in this age of growing technology see certain parts of education, specifically various programs and grades, to be the most imperative need to go anywhere. Students tend to do anything they can to get into the most advanced classes and programs with the best grades. This may look good as numbers on a screen, but doing this makes it so that their focus is on sustaining numbers on a screen rather than learning the material thoroughly  and gaining skills from them. I realize this and try to apply this wisdom to how I handle the way I learn. I'd rather have colleges become interested in me from things that I did with my skills compared to the courses I took and the grades I got in them.</h4>
                 	<h4 class="paragraph">This site contains all sorts of things, like my resume, projects I have done, and a bit about me as well! I hope you enjoy looking at the rest of the website, as I had fun creating it, and learning as I went. Thank you for your time to take a look at me and my interests!</h4>
